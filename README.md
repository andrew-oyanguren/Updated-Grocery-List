### General Information
This project was a revisit to an older project I created. I wanted to brush up on some JS knowledge, and also improve upon my first list project.
In this Project I added a selector with 3 options. This would fiter through checked off items and items that are still needed. I then took it a step
further and decide to save the users list to local storage, and remove the item from the stored array when the item gets deleted.
